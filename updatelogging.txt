🔢 Common Versioning Styles
1. Semantic Versioning (SemVer) – most professional

Format:
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR (1.0 → 2.0): Big changes, redesigns, or breaking changes.

MINOR (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2): New features added, but everything still works.

PATCH (1.0.0 → 1.0.1 → 1.0.2): Small fixes, bug patches, performance tweaks.

👉 Example flow:
v1.0.0 → v1.0.1 → v1.1.0 → v1.2.0 → v2.0.0

2. Beta / Alpha Tags – for testing versions

If you want to show "work-in-progress" updates:

v1.1-alpha → experimental / early test build

v1.1-beta → more stable, but still testing

v1.1-rc1 → release candidate (almost ready for full release)

v1.1 → final stable release

👉 Example flow:
v1.0 → v1.1-alpha → v1.1-beta → v1.1 → v1.2
